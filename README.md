# Beetriv
_A Secure Platform for Buying, Selling & Bidding Secondhand Items in Brunei_

## Project Overview
**Beetriv** is a web application developed as a **Final Year Project at Politeknik Brunei**. 

The platform addresses the growing concerns of secondhand buying and selling in Brunei, which often occurs through social media without any form of buyer protection, refunds, or agreements. Beetriv provides a **safe and reliable digital marketplace** for users to buy, sell, and bid on secondhand items while supporting **local thrift vendors and start-ups** in expanding their reach.
